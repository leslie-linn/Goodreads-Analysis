# Goodreads-Analysis
I am a big fan of reading all sorts of books, thus checking on Goodreads on my Kindle on a daily basis to get the newest information on what books to read.
In the project, I performed visulaization on data and KMeans prediction on similar books based on clusters. In the end, I used one of my favorite book, "Walden" by Thoreau,to test the unsupervised machine learning model.
